***CLOCK BATTERY FOOTPRINT NOTES***

The BK-92 footprint, when ordered from OSHPARK, didn't quite fit. The holes were too wide for the clip.  

Between the footprint, the part, and the as built, I could only confirm that the digital footprint was correct.  

I do know that opening one hole with a 5/64" bit improved the fit, and opening both holes made one clip fit perfectly, but a second clip was a bit loose. If a 4/64" bit ran cleanly, and opening it up 1/64" made it fit better, it means, the hole edges actually moved half a 64th closer together, which is .0078". It's really hard to make accurate measurements with the roughed over caliper edges, but I think the approach is to move the holes closer together by .010"

***RESULTS OF LASER CUT TEST PART*** 

"footprint test 2.sldprt" was laser cut in 1/16" THK acrylic. the following hole spacings had the best fits 

battery clips: .290" center to center 
potentiometer: .440" center to center
