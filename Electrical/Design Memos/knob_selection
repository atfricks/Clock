>**Executive Summary:** An archived memo details the experience of browsing Digikey and eventually settling on some encoders and potentiometers from a manufacturing company called Bourns. The right angle components were slightly more expensive, but they more than make up for the cost in terms of reduced assembly steps. This memo recaps the selection of specific part numbers.
