Lea ving them open is prob safer. There might be some chargers that might
have problem, unlikely, but def don't gnd it.  Even if charger goes to low
power usb mode its 100ma, shou?d be enoguh. U might want to put a diode
(schotky) in series with the 5V usb and another in series with battery,
that way it runs on bateries when no usb power and switches to battery when
unpluged.
