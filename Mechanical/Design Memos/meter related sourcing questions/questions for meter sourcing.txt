How does the image get lined up to the needle?



What do they do to check quality? How do I know that 0 is 0, how do I know that 50uA lines up with 12 hours or 60 minutes? How do they test the meters at the factory?


What are the total costs, including shipping, taxes, tariffs, etc?


Is sea shipping an option? Is it cheaper?


How are they packed? Is bulk packing an option? (as opposed to retail packaging) Does it save money?



Can you recommend a 3rd party agent for shipping from China to US?


Would they want to video chat with me over skype? I don't speak english but would like to say hello.



MOST IMPORTANT:

Is there a way for me to approve a first article before they ship the rest of the meters?


What about setting up payment terms? I would feel most comfortable getting an escrow account set up to hold the money separately.
