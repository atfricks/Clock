This is my take on what a desk clock would be in a world that isn't overrun by flashing LCD screens. This is the Model AWK-105 Analog Voltmeter Clock.

It's look and feel is heavily inspired by my grandfather's WWII era telegraph keyer. The sheet metal construction and the instrumentation knobs were so solid and substantial, it left no doubt as to the durability and quality of construction. To me, old analog equipment like that has a functional beauty and aesthetic quality that I really tried to capture with my Clock design.

Clock operation is simple. The key design feature is of course, the dual analog meters. The first meter's gage goes up to 12, for hours, and the other goes up to 60, for minutes.

The mode knob selects between time keeping and calibration modes, and the adjustment knob does what it's name would suggest, adjusting the time and calibration.

Behind the sheet metal enclosure, a 32.768 Khz crystal oscillator and an ATtiny microcontroller keep track of the time and power the machine.

We really want this Clock to be a keepsake that's worthy of a place on your desk for the years to come. We've gone through CAD modeling, laid out custom circuit boards, and written our own firmware, and we're ready to build a small batch of these. We're turning to Kickstarter to get funds so we can place bulk orders and bring this project to life. Please donate, and thank you for your support!
